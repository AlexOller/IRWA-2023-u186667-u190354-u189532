Instructions:

- Tu run our code it is needed to change the paths from the last cell on the 0.Imports and Paths part,
and change it to the user's own paths to the json file and the csv file respectively.

- Then the rest consist in executing all cells in order, there are no more changes needed nor any kind of use instruction,
since the code will run automatically and it will not ask for the collaboration of the user to output any result.
