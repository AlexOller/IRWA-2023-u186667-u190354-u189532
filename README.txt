Instructions:

- Tu run our code it is needed to change the path from tweets_path on the imports and paths cell (path to the Rus_Ukr_war_data.json) and the id_to_docs_path (path to the Rus_Ukr_war_data_ids.csv).

- Then the rest consist in executing all cells in order, there are no more changes needed nor any kind of use instruction, since the code will run automatically and it will not ask for the collaboration of the user to output any result.
